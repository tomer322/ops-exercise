# ops-exercise
I took the liberty of utilizing your README.md template for my documentation if you do not mind :)

The exercise was tested on Fedaora 28 using Python 3.6.6, Docker CE 18.06.1 and Docker Compose 1.22.0
## Requirements

As written above, This deployment was tested on almost the latest of docker and python packages and would probably work on much lesser versions, though, I would recommend the versions which are written above.

The deployment script utilizes only built-in modules which I cannnot guarantee that will exists on lower versions of python. Please take this into account.
## Running Instructions

After cloning this repository, simply cd to it's directory and run the deployment script with root permissions
```
git clone https://github.com/tomer322/ops-exercise.git
cd ops-exercise
sudo ./deploy.py
```

## Comments

I have emphasized on the deployment script (Mostly because there wasn't much Ops to do in this exercise) so you could assess my developing skills in python, since you have told me this is an important part of this position.
